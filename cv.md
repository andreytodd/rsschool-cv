## 🙋‍♂️ About me
  - Beginner frontend developer with ambitions. I take programming as an art and a way to express myself. Nothing is more beatiful than a good-written code. I want to create something people would be using in their everyday life and enjoying it. 
  - My goal is to become full-stack developer and help others discover the world of programming. 
  - Currently working as an international sales manager, and learning web development with rs-school and other online courses.
